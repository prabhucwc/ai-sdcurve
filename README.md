Stage-Discharge Relationship Modeling with LLM-Assisted Development
Project Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a study investigating the development of a stage-discharge relationship (rating curve) for a generic river gauging station. A key focus of this project is to demonstrate the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in streamlining and accelerating the hydrological modeling workflow, specifically for generating the Python code required for non-linear regression.

The project aims to:

Develop a robust stage-discharge rating curve using a power-law equation.

Showcase the efficiency and utility of LLM-assisted code generation for hydrological modeling tasks.

Evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the derived rating curve using standard statistical metrics.

Key Features
LLM-Assisted Code Generation: Demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged to generate Python code for complex mathematical modeling (e.g., non-linear least squares regression).

Stage-Discharge Curve Fitting: Implements a power-law equation to model the relationship between water stage and discharge.

Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for handling missing values and preparing time-series hydrological data.

Model Evaluation: Utilizes key statistical metrics (R-squared, RMSE, MAE) to assess the goodness-of-fit of the derived rating curve.

Residual Analysis: Provides code for visualizing and analyzing model residuals to identify potential biases or areas for improvement.

Google Colab Integration: Designed for easy execution and reproducibility within the Google Colab environment.

Open in Google Colab: Click the "Open in Colab" badge (if provided, or manually create a new Colab notebook).

Upload Data:

Ensure your data file (e.g., .xlsx, .csv) containing 'Date/Time', 'Stage' (Water Level), and 'Discharge' columns is ready.

In the Colab notebook, execute the code cell containing from google.colab import files; uploaded = files.upload().

A file selection dialog will appear. Select your data file and upload it.

Run Cells: Execute the Colab notebook cells sequentially. The necessary libraries are pre-installed in the Colab environment.

Usage
The notebook guides you through the following steps:

Data Loading: Upload your dataset containing historical stage and discharge values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial data inspection, missing value handling, and visualization of data distributions and time series.

Model Definition: Define the power-law equation function for the rating curve.

Model Calibration: Perform non-linear least squares regression using scipy.optimize.curve_fit to determine the optimal parameters for the rating curve.

Model Evaluation: Calculate and display goodness-of-fit metrics (R-squared, RMSE, MAE) for the derived curve.

Residual Analysis: Generate and analyze plots of residuals to assess model performance and identify areas for improvement.

Visualization: Plot the fitted rating curve against the observed data for visual assessment.

Data
The project expects a data file (e.g., Excel .xlsx, CSV .csv) with at least three columns:

Date/Time: Date or timestamp of the observation.

Stage: Water level measurements (e.g., in meters).

Discharge: Flow rate measurements (e.g., in cubic meters per second).

Please replace the placeholder filename (e.g., your_excel_file.xlsx) in the code with the actual name of your uploaded file.

Results Summary (Example)
The fitted power-law equation for the stage-discharge relationship demonstrated a strong fit to the observed data. Key evaluation metrics typically include:

R-squared (RÂ²): A high value (e.g., close to 1) indicating nearly all variance explained.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): A low value (in discharge units) representing the average magnitude of errors, giving more weight to larger ones.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): A low value (in discharge units) representing the average absolute difference between observed and fitted values.

Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): A low percentage indicating relative error, though interpretation requires caution for values near zero.

Residual analysis generally indicates a concentration of errors around zero, supporting the model's overall fit, though visual inspection often highlights areas for potential refinement.

Future Work and Improvements
Alternative Model Structures: Investigate other functional forms (e.g., polynomial, piecewise functions) to potentially capture more complex stage-discharge dynamics.

Advanced Calibration: Employ more sophisticated optimization algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms, Bayesian methods) for parameter estimation.

Seasonal Decomposition: Apply seasonal decomposition techniques to the stage and discharge time series to analyze and potentially account for seasonal variations in the rating curve.

Uncertainty Quantification: Develop methods to quantify the uncertainty associated with the fitted curve and its parameters.

Incorporation of Additional Variables: Explore the influence of other hydrological or geomorphological factors (e.g., sediment load, channel changes) on the stage-discharge relationship.

LLM Integration Enhancement: Further explore how LLMs can assist in more advanced aspects of hydrological modeling, such as automated feature engineering, anomaly detection, or report generation.
